# Intelligent-task-offloading-in-autonoums-vehicular-networks-using-deep-learning
This project applies Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for task offloading in Vehicular Fog Computing (VFC), optimizing resource use among vehicles, RSUs, and the cloud to reduce latency and energy consumption. A PPO-based RL model improves scheduling and efficiency, outperforming traditional methods in dynamic vehicular networks.
